## 3. Competitor Analysis  
Studied major EdTech players:  
- **Coursera** – great variety, but extremely low completion rates

- **upGrad** – strong university tie-ups, but expensive and time-heavy  
- **Simplilearn** – strong industry partnerships, but inconsistent quality  

📌 None address the *confidence gap* in choosing the right next skill.
