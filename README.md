# 📚 What Should I Learn Next? – MVP Exploration

This repository documents my project on solving a critical question faced by early professionals:  
**“What should I learn next?”**

The internet is overflowing with learning resources — courses, tutorials, newsletters, podcasts, AI tools. But young professionals often feel overwhelmed, unsure, and anxious about choosing the right next skill. This project is my attempt to design and prototype an MVP that helps users **discover, commit to, and act on their next learning goal** in a way that is personalized, motivating, and sustainable.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Millions of learners want to upskill but struggle with:
- Overwhelming options
- Lack of clarity on which skill aligns with their goals
- Fear of wasting time or money
- Research paralysis and endless bookmarking
- Low confidence and low completion rates  

I set out to explore how a product could help **reduce overwhelm and increase confidence** in choosing and committing to the *next* learning step.

## 🔍 Research & Insights
To better understand the problem space, I explored:
- **Competitive Research**: Existing platforms (Coursera, Udemy, YouTube, LinkedIn Learning) and their gaps  
- **Secondary Research**: Articles, blogs, and studies on learner behavior and decision-making  
- **Primary Insights**: Conversations with peers about their struggles with learning consistency  

You can find detailed references in the [`/research`](./research) folder.

## 🛠️ MVP Concept
The MVP focuses on:
- **Personalized skill discovery** (guided by goals and constraints)
