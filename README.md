---

## 1. Problem Statement  
Young professionals are overwhelmed by endless online learning options and struggle to answer a simple but high-stakes question:  
**“What should I learn next?”**

## 2. Market Assessment  
- Conducted a **Google Form survey** with early-career professionals (responses linked in repo).  
- [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfh0pnseQ7TPNVCm63-X1BYcYTCT5ml1yFejrHv8BQSIEN4-A/viewform)  
- [Survey Responses](./Elev8%20Survey%20(Responses).xlsx)  

**Key insights from user survey:**  
- Overchoice creates confusion  
- Lack of career-linked roadmaps  
- Low motivation & accountability  
- Fear of wasting time/money  

---

## 3. Competitor Analysis  
Studied major EdTech players:  
- **Coursera** – great variety, but extremely low completion rates  
- **Udemy** – cheap, wide content, but low credibility  
- **upGrad** – strong university tie-ups, but expensive and time-heavy  
- **Simplilearn** – strong industry partnerships, but inconsistent quality  

None addresses the *confidence gap* in choosing the right next skill.
